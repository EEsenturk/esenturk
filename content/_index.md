Hi, I am Emre. Welcome to my website.

I am a research fellow at [NDM Oxford ](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/). I am also a lecturer at [Jesus College, Oxford](https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk)

I am an applied mathematician with a wide spectrum of interests. My research is centered at modeling and analysis of real-world systems using analytical and computational techniques. Application areas include cancer research, connected autonomous vehicles, climate modeling, and 3D printing.

Throughout my graduate education and professional life, I have acquired significant amount of experience that has embedded in me the pedagogical principles behind my teaching. I am currently working as a Lecturer/Tutor at Jesus College, Oxford University.

I have also worked as a teaching assistant as well as a module leader for various undergraduate and postgraduate level modules.
